====== Torch Tutorial ======
{{anchor:torch.tutorial}}

So you are wondering how to work with Torch?
This is a little tutorial that should help get you started.

By the end of this tutorial, you should have managed to install torch
on your machine, and have a good understanding of how to manipulate
vectors, matrices and tensors and how to build and train a basic
neural network. For anything else, you should know how to access the
html help and read about how to do it.

======  What is Torch? ======

Torch7 provides a Matlab-like environment for state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms. It is easy to use and provides a very efficient
implementation, thanks to a easy and fast scripting language (Lua) and
an underlying C/C++ implementation.  You can read more about Lua
[[http://www.lua.org|here]].

======  Installation ======

First before you can do anything, you need to install Torch7 on your
machine.  That is not described in detail here, but is instead
described in the [[..:install:index|installation help]].


======  Checking your installation works and requiring packages ======

If you have got this far, hopefully your Torch installation works. A simple
way to make sure it does is to start Lua from the shell command line, 
and then try to start Torch:
<file lua>
$ torch
Try the IDE: torch -ide
Type help() for more info
Torch 7.0  Copyright (C) 2001-2011 Idiap, NEC Labs, NYU
Lua 5.1  Copyright (C) 1994-2008 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
t7> 
t7> x = torch.Tensor()
t7> print(x)
[torch.DoubleTensor with no dimension]

</file>

You might have to specify the exact path of the ''torch'' executable
if you installed Torch in a non-standard path.

In this example, we checked Torch was working by creating an empty
[[..:torch:tensor|Tensor]] and printing it on the screen.  The Tensor
is the main tool in Torch, and is used to represent vector, matrices
or higher-dimensional objects (tensors).

''torch'' only preloads the basic parts of torch (including
Tensors). To see the list of all packages distributed with Torch7,
click [[..:index|here]].

====== Getting Help ======

There are two main ways of getting help in Torch7. One way is ofcourse
the html formatted help. However, another and easier method is to use
inline help in torch interpreter. The ''torch'' executable also
integrates this capability. Help about any function can be accessed by
calling the ''help()'' function.

<file lua>

t7> help(torch.rand)

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
torch.rand( [res,] m [, n, k, ...])        
 y=torch.rand(n) returns a one-dimensional tensor of size n filled with 
random numbers from a uniform distribution on the interval (0,1).
 y=torch.rand(m,n) returns a mxn tensor of random numbers from a uniform 
distribution on the interval (0,1).
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

</file>

Even a more intuitive method is to use tab completion. Whenever any
input is entered at the ''torch'' prompt, one can eneter two
consecutive ''TAB'' characters (''double TAB'') to get the syntax
completion. Moreover entering ''double TAB'' at an open paranthesis
also causes the help for that particular function to be printed.

<file lua>

t7> torch.randn( -- enter double TAB after (
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
torch.randn( [res,] m [, n, k, ...])       
 y=torch.randn(n) returns a one-dimensional tensor of size n filled with 
random numbers from a normal distribution with mean zero and variance 
one.
 y=torch.randn(m,n) returns a mxn tensor of random numbers from a normal 
distribution with mean zero and variance one.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

/  \  
t7> torch.randn(

</file>

======  Torch basics: playing with Tensors ======

Ok, now we are ready to actually do something in Torch.  Lets start by
constructing a vector, say a vector with 5 elements, and filling the
i-th element with value i. Here's how:

<file lua>
t7> x=torch.Tensor(5)
t7> for i=1,5 do x[i]=i; end
t7> print(x)

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
[torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 5] 

t7>
</file>

However, making use of Lua's powerfull closures and functions being
first class citizens of the language, the same code could be written
in much nicer way:

<file lua>
t7> x=torch.Tensor(5)
t7> i=0;x:apply(function() i=i+1;return i; end)
t7> =x
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
[torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 5]

t7> x:apply(function(x) return x^2; end)
t7> =x
  1
  4
  9
 16
 25
[torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 5]

t7> 
</file>

To make a matrix (2-dimensional Tensor), one simply does something
like ''x=torch.Tensor(5,5)'' instead:

<file lua>
x=torch.Tensor(5,5)
for i=1,5 do 
 for j=1,5 do 
   x[i][j]=math.random();
 end
end
</file>

Another way to do the same thing as the code above is provided by torch:

<file lua>
x=torch.rand(5,5)
</file>

The [[..:torch:maths|torch]] package contains a wide variety of commands 
for manipulating Tensors that follow rather closely the equivalent
Matlab commands. For example one can construct Tensors using the commands
[[..:torch:maths#torch.ones|ones]], 
[[..:torch:maths#torch.zeros|zeros]], 
[[..:torch:maths#torch.rand|rand]],
[[..:torch:maths#torch.randn|randn]] and
[[..:torch:maths#torch.eye|eye]], amongst others.

Similarly, row or column-wise operations such as 
[[..:torch:maths#torch.sum|sum]] and 
[[..:torch:maths#torch.max|max]] are called in the same way:

<file lua>
t7> x1=torch.rand(5,5)
t7> x2=torch.sum(x1); 
t7> print(x2) 
 2.3450
 2.7099
 2.5044
 3.6897
 2.4089
[torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 5x1]

t7>
</file>


====== Types in Torch7 ======

In Torch7, different types of tensors can be used. By default, all
tensors are created using ''double'' type. ''torch.Tensor'' is a
convenience call to ''torch.DoubleTensor''. One can easily switch the
default tensor type to other types, like ''float''.

<file lua>
t7> =torch.Tensor()
[torch.DoubleTensor with no dimension]
t7> torch.setdefaulttensortype('torch.FloatTensor')
t7> =torch.Tensor()
[torch.FloatTensor with no dimension]
</file>

======  Example: training a neural network ======

We will show now how to train a neural network using the [[..:nn:index|nn]] package
available in Torch.

=====  Torch basics: building a dataset using Lua tables =====

In general the user has the freedom to create any kind of structure he
wants for dealing with data.

For example, training a neural network in Torch is achieved easily by
performing a loop over the data, and forwarding/backwarding tensors
through the network. Then, the way the dataset is built is left to the
user's creativity.


However, if you want to use some convenience classes, like
[[..:nn:index#nn.StochasticGradient|StochasticGradient]], which basically
does the training loop for you, one has to follow the dataset
convention of these classes.  (We will discuss manual training of a
network, where one does not use these convenience classes, in a later
section.)

StochasticGradient expects as a ''dataset'' an object which implements
the operator ''dataset[index]'' and implements the method
''dataset:size()''. The ''size()'' methods returns the number of
examples and ''dataset[i]'' has to return the i-th example.

An ''example'' has to be an object which implements the operator
''example[field]'', where ''field'' often takes the value ''1'' (for
input features) or ''2'' (for corresponding labels), i.e an example is
a pair of input and output objects.  The input is usually a Tensor
(exception: if you use special kind of gradient modules, like
[[..:nn:index#nn.TableLayers|table layers]]). The label type depends
on the criterion. For example, the
[[..:nn:index#nn.MSECriterion|MSECriterion]] expects a Tensor, but the
[[..:nn:index#nn.ClassNLLCriterion|ClassNLLCriterion]] expects an
integer (the class).

Such a dataset is easily constructed by using Lua tables, but it could any object
as long as the required operators/methods are implemented.

Here is an example of making a dataset for an XOR type problem:
<file lua>
dataset={};
function dataset:size() return 100 end -- 100 examples
for i=1,dataset:size() do 
	local input= torch.randn(2);     --normally distributed example in 2d
	local output= torch.Tensor(1);
	if input[1]*input[2]>0 then    --calculate label for XOR function
		output[1]=-1;
	else
		output[1]=1;
	end
	dataset[i] = {input, output};
end
</file>

=====  Torch basics: building a neural network =====

To train a neural network we first need some data.  We can use the XOR data
we just generated in the section before.  Now all that remains is to define
our network architecture, and train it.

To use Neural Networks in Torch you have to require the 
[[..:nn:index|nn]] package. 
A classical feed-forward network is created with the ''Sequential'' object:
<file lua>
require "nn"
mlp=nn.Sequential();  -- make a multi-layer perceptron
</file>

To build the layers of the network, you simply add the Torch objects 
corresponding to those layers to the //mlp// variable created above.

The two basic objects you might be interested in first are the 
[[..:nn:index#nn.Linear|Linear]] and 
[[..:nn:index#nn.Tanh|Tanh]] layers.
The Linear layer is created with two parameters: the number of input
dimensions, and the number of output dimensions. 
So making a classical feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer with 
//HUs// hidden units is as follows:
<file lua>
require "nn"
mlp=nn.Sequential();  -- make a multi-layer perceptron
inputs=2; outputs=1; HUs=20;
mlp:add(nn.Linear(inputs,HUs))
mlp:add(nn.Tanh())
mlp:add(nn.Linear(HUs,outputs))
</file>


=====  Torch basics: training a neural network =====

Now we're ready to train.
This is done with the following code:
<file lua>
criterion = nn.MSECriterion()  
trainer = nn.StochasticGradient(mlp, criterion)
trainer.learningRate = 0.01
trainer:train(dataset)
</file>

You should see printed on the screen something like this:
<file lua>
# StochasticGradient: training
# current error = 0.94550937745458
# current error = 0.83996744568527
# current error = 0.70880093908742
# current error = 0.58663679932706
# current error = 0.49190661630473
[..snip..]
# current error = 0.34533844015756
# current error = 0.344305927029
# current error = 0.34321901952818
# current error = 0.34206793525954
# StochasticGradient: you have reached the maximum number of iterations
</file>

Some other options of the //trainer// you might be interested in are for example:
<file lua>
trainer.maxIteration = 10
trainer.shuffleIndices = false
</file>
See the nn package description of the
[[..:nn:index#nn.StochasticGradient|StochasticGradient]] object
for more details.


=====  Torch basics: testing your neural network =====

To test your network on a single example you can do this:
<file lua>
x=torch.Tensor(2);   -- create a test example Tensor
x[1]=0.5; x[2]=-0.5; -- set its values
pred=mlp:forward(x)  -- get the prediction of the mlp 
print(pred)          -- print it 
</file>

You should see that your network has learned XOR:
<file lua>
t7> x=torch.Tensor(2); x[1]=0.5; x[2]=0.5; print(mlp:forward(x))
-0.5886
[torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 1]

t7> x=torch.Tensor(2); x[1]=-0.5; x[2]=0.5; print(mlp:forward(x))
 0.9261
[torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 1]

t7> x=torch.Tensor(2); x[1]=0.5; x[2]=-0.5; print(mlp:forward(x))
 0.7913
[torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 1]

t7> x=torch.Tensor(2); x[1]=-0.5; x[2]=-0.5; print(mlp:forward(x))
-0.5576
[torch.DoubleTensor of dimension 1]
</file>

=====  Manual Training of a Neural Network =====

Instead of using the [[..:nn:index#nn.StochasticGradient|StochasticGradient]] class
you can directly make the forward and backward calls on the network yourself.
This gives you greater flexibility.
In the following code example we create the same XOR data on the fly
and train each example online.

<file lua>
criterion = nn.MSECriterion()  
mlp=nn.Sequential();  -- make a multi-layer perceptron
inputs=2; outputs=1; HUs=20;
mlp:add(nn.Linear(inputs,HUs))
mlp:add(nn.Tanh())
mlp:add(nn.Linear(HUs,outputs))

for i = 1,2500 do
  -- random sample
  local input= torch.randn(2);     -- normally distributed example in 2d
  local output= torch.Tensor(1);
  if input[1]*input[2] > 0 then  -- calculate label for XOR function
    output[1] = -1
  else
    output[1] = 1
  end

  -- feed it to the neural network and the criterion
  prediction = mlp:forward(input)
  criterion:forward(prediction, output)

  -- train over this example in 3 steps

  -- (1) zero the accumulation of the gradients
  mlp:zeroGradParameters()

  -- (2) accumulate gradients
  criterion_gradient = criterion:backward(prediction, output)
  mlp:backward(input, criterion_gradient)

  -- (3) update parameters with a 0.01 learning rate
  mlp:updateParameters(0.01)
end
</file>

Super!

====== Concluding remarks ======

That's the end of this tutorial, but not the end of what you have left
to discover of Torch! To explore more of Torch, you should take a look
at the [[..:index|Torch package help]] which has been linked to
throughout this tutorial every time we have mentioned one of the basic
Torch object types.  The Torch library reference manual is available
[[..:index|here]] and the external torch packages installed on your
system can be viewed [[..:torch:index|here]].

Good luck and have fun!
